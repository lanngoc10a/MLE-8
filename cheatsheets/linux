Error in VM: Operating system disk has run out of disk space. Clear at least 5 GB disk space on OS disk (/dev/sda1/ filesystem mounted on /) through the terminal by removing files/folders, and then do sudo reboot. You can check available disk space by running df -h.  For more details refer to https://aka.ms/cidiskfull
The VM disk is full. Delete jobs, tasks, or files on the node to free up space and then reboot the node.

Just to share a magic command to know where all your disk space goes:
sudo du -hsx /* | sort -rh | head -n 40

Then you can start again from another folder:
sudo du -hsx /home/* | sort -rh | head -n 35

Use the rm command to remove files you no longer need. The rm command removes the entries for a specified file, group of files, or certain select files from a list within a directory. User confirmation, read permission, and write permission are not required before a file is removed when you use the rm command. However, you must have write permission for the directory containing the file.

To delete the file named myfile, type the following:
rm myfile

To delete all the files in the mydir directory, one by one, type the following:
rm -i mydir/*

To remove an empty directory, use either rmdir or rm -d followed by the directory name:
rm -d dirname
